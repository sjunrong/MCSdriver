MCSdriver is a novel computational model that integrates network and pathway information to prioritize cancer driver gene identification. MCSdriver employs a bidirectional random walk algorithm to quantify the mutual exclusivity and functional relationships between mutated genes within patient cohorts, and calculates similarity scores based on a mutual exclusivity-weighted network and pathway coverage patterns. The model accounts for patient-specific heterogeneity and molecular profile similarity, enhancing the accuracy and quality of driver gene identification.
The application of MCSdriver is in the R evironment.
Running the MCSdriver required:
1. Source the pathway_networks.R
2. Running the main function with the required input data, such as the patient mutation matrix (patMutMatrix), the patient dysregulated expression matrix (patOutMatrix), the Protein-Protein Interaction network (PPI), and the weighted mutual exclusive ratio network （FIs1）, the pathways of the mutated genes for each cancer type. There are examples for the input data in the data file.
3. the weighted mutual exclusive ratio network（FIs1） can be generated by the script of calculate_weight.R
4. the output of MCSDriver is a ranking list of l3 with two columns e.g. the ranking driver gene list and the corresponding scores. The example of hnsc cancer list in the data file of results.csv
